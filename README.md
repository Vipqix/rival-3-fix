# ℹ **INFO: Firmware**
```
I just found the firmware somewhere in my files 👍
```

# 🧠 **HOW TO USE** 

# 1. 🐍 **Install python** 
   - Download python from https://python.org (i'm using python 3.12.6).
   - In the installer one of the first pages should say add to path, check that.
   - Smart filtering to exclude irrelevant listings.

     **Alternative**: Just install python from the microsoft store *(auto adds to path)*.

# 2. 📦 **Install required package** 
   - If you have python installed and added to path, open cmd and type in `pip install hidapi`.

# 3. 🏃‍♀️ **run main.py** 
   - Make sure your rival 3 is plugged in when running the file.
   - After that your mouse should work but if you unplug/restart your computer 
   you'll have to rerun the program (so do step 4).

# 4. ⏬ **Update firmware**
   - Go into SteelSeries GG and where your mouse is it should say `CRITICAL UPDATE: Click to install new firmware.`
   - Update the firmware and then the LED on your mousewheel should change from purple/pinkish to orange or any other color.

# 5. ❌ **Errors**
   - If you update your firmware and it breaks the mouse, rerun main.py or the software in my releases and try reinstalling firmware a couple of times.
